***BLOCK ONE****
##[X] 1) Save csv with ganerated graph
##[X] 2) Check code to generate the graph
##[X] 3) Come up with a graph visualisation
##[ ] 4) Setup bash model to run in the terminal
##[X] 5) Explain How I create the graph
##[X] 6) Share dataset with her 
##[X] 7) Explain How I create the visualisation
##[X] 8) I must ask her to develop a method to analyses the whole graphs dataset
    - Probably using excel
    - There other tools can load the graph dataset
    - OBS: We will be able to know the best parameters/setting to create the graph
##[X] 9) Think toguether how set paramether for the graph
    - We may try to start with more terms/titles/topics ??
    - Turn on the filter for huge_data colection 
    - How many interations ??
    - Should we use how many nodes for visualisatio??
    - OBS: She may experiment with the bash too for graph visualisation
##[X] 10) Should we get add more filter?
    - location: Australia
    - Language: English


***BLOCK TWO****
##[X] 1) How should be the table with the references
##[X] 2) From How many pages should we stract the ferecencesâ€ 
##[X] 3) Fix titlo to get the references
##[X] 4) I may use the python wiki api go get the HTML of the page
##[X] 5) Get a sample of the references
##[X] 6) Sen the samples for her to analyses
##[X] 7) Check why some pages do not have Qids
##[X] 8) Check OpenRefine: Download
##[X] 9) Fix case on the graph
##[X] 10) remove: 
        i) Links that are not WP pages 
        ii) Links that are WD pages but not WP pages
##[X] 11) Clean the code: utils + knolwdge_graph
        i) Remove comments
        ii) Remove ToDO tag
        iii) Remove BUG tag
##[ ] 12) preper code for user
        [X] knolwdge_graph.py
        [ ] rank_and_qid.py
        [ ] checking_wp.py (may not necessary)
        [ ] redo_kg.py (may not necessary)


##[ ] 13) Write a readme
        i) Project description
        ii) Documentation

##[ ] 14) How to connect to Wikidata python
##[ ] 15) Check open refine file she sent 
##[ ] 16) Check OpenRefine: use

##[ ] send table to her
##[ ] improve code to collect standudard references -> lossing part of the information 
##[ ] generate a table with out of standudard references
##[ ] send table to her
