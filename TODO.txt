##[X] 1) Save csv with ganerated graph
##[X] 2) Check code to generate the graph
##[X] 3) Come up with a graph visualisation
##[ ] 4) Setup bash model to run in the terminal
##[ ] 5) Explain How I create the graph
##[ ] 5) Explain How I create the visualisation
##[ ] 6) I must ask her to develop a method to analyses the whole graphs dataset
    - Probably using excel
    - There other tools can load the graph dataset
    - OBS: We will be able to know the best parameters/setting to create the graph
##[ ] 7) Think toguether how set paramether for the graph
    - We may try to start with more terms/titles/topics ??
    - Turn on the filter for huge_data colection 
    - How many interations ??
    - Should we use how many nodes for visualisatio??
    - OBS: She may experiment with the bash too for graph visualisation
