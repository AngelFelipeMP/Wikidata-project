***BLOCK ONE****
##[X] 1) Save csv with ganerated graph
##[X] 2) Check code to generate the graph
##[X] 3) Come up with a graph visualisation
##[ ] 4) Setup bash model to run in the terminal
##[X] 5) Explain How I create the graph
##[X] 6) Share dataset with her 
##[X] 7) Explain How I create the visualisation
##[X] 8) I must ask her to develop a method to analyses the whole graphs dataset
    - Probably using excel
    - There other tools can load the graph dataset
    - OBS: We will be able to know the best parameters/setting to create the graph
##[X] 9) Think toguether how set paramether for the graph
    - We may try to start with more terms/titles/topics ??
    - Turn on the filter for huge_data colection 
    - How many interations ??
    - Should we use how many nodes for visualisatio??
    - OBS: She may experiment with the bash too for graph visualisation
##[X] 10) Should we get add more filter?
    - location: Australia
    - Language: English


***BLOCK TWO****
##[X] 1) How should be the table with the references
##[X] 2) From How many pages should we stract the ferecencesâ€ 
##[X] 3) Fix titlo to get the references
##[X] 4) I may use the python wiki api go get the HTML of the page
##[X] 5) Get a sample of the references
##[X] 6) Sen the samples for her to analyses
##[X] 7) Check why some pages do not have Qids
##[X] 8) Check OpenRefine: Download
##[X] 9) Fix case on the graph
##[X] 10) remove: 
        i) Links that are not WP pages 
        ii) Links that are WD pages but not WP pages
##[X] 11) Clean the code: utils + knolwdge_graph
        i) Remove comments
        ii) Remove ToDO tag
        iii) Remove BUG tag

##[X] 14) How to connect to Wikidata python
##[X] 15) Check open refine file she sent 
##[X] 16) Check OpenRefine: use

***BLOCK THREE****
##[X] write script for generate a reference table with atributtes into the columns
##[X] write code to collect out of standudard references
##[X] send table to her
##[X] improve code to collect standudard references -> lossing part of the information 
##[X] generate a table with out of standudard references
##[X] send table to her


##[ ] I must chage in the file 'Wikipedia-links-plus-QID-27-Oct-2023-final-list-14-Nov-2023.csv' to 'links_plus_qids_official.csv'
##[ ] in documentation, I probably should give a 'name + Offical version + date' for documentation Official versions.
##[ ] I must dele test.py
##[ ] I may delete checking_wp.py
##[ ] I may improve the code not removing "\n" -> text = text.replace("\n", " ")
##[ ] I may create a option for 'mix' template + text 


***BLOCK FOUR****
##[ ] check analyse_ref_problem script -> Do I need this script?
##[ ] check checking_wp.py -> Do I need this script?
##[ ] check config.py
##[ ] fix rank_and_qid.py 
        -> Why I did not have problems with '/' in the Wikipedia pages ?
        -> In the outcome '/' most become '%2F'
##[ ] check the overall repo


****BLOCK FIVE*****

        [ ] checking_wp.py (may not necessary)
        [ ] redo_kg.py (may not necessary)


##[ ] 13) Write a readme
